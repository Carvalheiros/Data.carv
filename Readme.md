Extracting any information from PDFs

This is a python file

- Purpose

The script allows you to read and extract any information from PDF files. It processes the documents, extracts the specified data and organizes it in an Excel spreadsheet and/or inserts it into a MySQL database.

- How it works
1. Reading the PDFs: The script accesses a directory containing the PDF files and goes through each document.
2. Data extraction: Uses regular expressions (Regex) to identify patterns in the extracted text, allowing any desired information to be captured.
3. Storage: The extracted data is entered into a MySQL database and saved in an Excel file for future analysis.
4. Error handling: Any failure in the extraction is logged and the document is marked as “Error”.

- Solved Problems

Automates the extraction of information without the need for manual reading.
Improves efficiency when processing large volumes of documents.
Facilitates data organization and analysis.

- Example of use

Scenario: A company receives hundreds of PDF invoices and needs to extract the invoice number and date for accounting purposes.
1. The script is configured to recognize patterns such as “INVOICE #” and “DATE:” (The script is configured to recognize patterns such as “INVOICE #” and “DATE:”, but it can search for any other data, just change the patterns to search for new data.)
2. When you run the code, it processes all the PDFs in the directory and extracts the information.
3. The extracted data is stored in the database and exported to Excel.
